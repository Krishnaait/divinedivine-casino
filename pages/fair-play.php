Fair play is the foundation of our platform, and we implement rigorous measures to ensure that every game is conducted with integrity and transparency.</p>

                <h2>2. Random Number Generator (RNG)</h2>
                <h3>2.1 Certified RNG Technology</h3>
                <p>All games on our platform use <strong>Certified Random Number Generators (RNG)</strong> to ensure completely random and unpredictable outcomes. Our RNG systems:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Are independently tested and certified by recognized gaming authorities</li>
                    <li>Generate outcomes that are statistically random and unpredictable</li>
                    <li>Cannot be manipulated or influenced by any party, including us</li>
                    <li>Undergo regular audits to maintain certification standards</li>
                    <li>Meet international standards for gaming fairness (ISO/IEC 17025)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 How RNG Works</h3>
                <p>Our RNG systems use complex mathematical algorithms to generate random sequences of numbers. These numbers determine game outcomes such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dice rolls in the Dice Game</li>
                    <li>Mine placements in the Mines Game</li>
                    <li>Ball trajectories in the Plinko Game</li>
                    <li>Obstacle positions in the Chicken Adventure</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each outcome is independent of previous results, ensuring that past games do not influence future outcomes.</p>

                <h3>2.3 RNG Testing and Certification</h3>
                <p>Our RNG systems are regularly tested by independent third-party auditors to verify:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>True randomness of generated numbers</li>
                    <li>Absence of patterns or predictability</li>
                    <li>Compliance with statistical distribution standards</li>
                    <li>Protection against manipulation or tampering</li>
                </ul>
